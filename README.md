# o2r-finder

Implementation of search features for the o2r API.

## Architecture

Since we want a simple auto-suggest search functionality, which is not readily available with MongoDB (though it has [full text search](https://github.com/o2r-project/o2r-finder/issues/1)), the finder utilizes Elasticsearch.

Since we don't want to worry about keeping things in sync, the finder simply re-indices the whole database at startup and then subscribes to changes in the MongoDB using [node-elasticsearch-sync](https://github.com/toystars/node-elasticsearch-sync) (for both steps).

The Elasticsearch search endpoint is then published read-only via an nginx proxy.

## Indexed information

- whole database _muncher_ (an _index_ in Elasticsearch)
  - all compendia (_collection_ in MongodB, a _type_ in Elasticsearch)
    - txt __[TODO]__
    - pdf __[TODO]__
  - all jobs (_collection_ in MongodB, a _type_ in Elasticsearch)

### Compendia

The MongoDB id is stored as the entry id to allow deletion in Elasticsearch when an element is removed from MongoDB.

The "public" ID for the compendium is stored in `compendium_id`.

Example:

```json
(...])
"hits": {
    "total": 5,
    "max_score": 1.0,
    "hits": [
        {
            "_index": "o2r",
            "_type": "compendia",
            "_id": "57b2eabfa0cd335b5d1192cc",
            "_score": 1.0,
            "_source": {
                "id": "57b2eabfa0cd335b5d1192cc",
                "user": "0000-0001-6021-1617",
                "jobs": [ ],
                "created": "2016-08-16T10:28:15.744Z",
                "compendium_id": "szSuZ"
            }
        }
    ]
    (...)
}
(...)
```

## Requirements

- Elasticsearch server
- Docker
- Node.js
- MondoDB, running with a replication set (!)

## Dockerfile

This project includes a Dockerfile which can be built with

```bash
docker build -t o2r-finder .
```

The image can then be run and configured via environment variables.

### Available environment variables

- `FINDER_MONGODB` **Required** Hostname for the MongoDB, defaults to `localhost'
- `FINDER_MONGODB_DATABASE` **Required** Database name in MongodB, defaults to `muncher`
- `FINDER_ELASTICSEARCH` **Required** Elasticsearch endpoint, defaults to `elasticsearch:9200`
- `FINDER_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX` **Required** Name of the index in Elasticsearch, defaults to `o2r`
- `FINDER_MONGODB_COLL_COMPENDIA` Name of the MongoDB collection for compendia, default is `compendia`
- `FINDER_MONGODB_COLL_JOBS` Name of the MongoDB collection for jobs, default is `jobs`
- `FINDER_ELASTICSEARCH_TYPE_COMPENDIA` Name of the Elasticsearch type for compendia, default is `compendia`
- `FINDER_ELASTICSEARCH_TYPE_JOBS` Name of the Elasticsearch type for jobs, default is `jobs`

## Development

Start an Elasticsearch instance, mounting a local configuratione file (see [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/)), and exposing the default port on the host.

```bash
cd elasticsearch
docker build -t o2r-elasticsearch .
docker run -it --name elasticsearch -v "$(pwd)/elasticsearch.yml":/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml -p 9200:9200 o2r-elasticsearch
```

You can then explore the state of Elasticsearch, e.g.

- http://localhost:9200/
- http://localhost:9200/_nodes
- http://localhost:9200/_cat/health?v
- http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v

Start finder (potentially adjust Elasticsearch container's IP, see `docker inspect elasticsearch`)

```bash
npm install
DEBUG=finder FINDER_ELASTICSEARCH=localhost:9200 npm start;
```

You can set `DEBUG=*` to see MongoDB oplog messages.

Now check out the transferred documents:

- http://localhost:9200/o2r
- http://localhost:9200/o2r/compendia/_search?q=*&pretty
- http://localhost:9200/o2r/compendia/57b2eabfa0cd335b5d1192cc (use an ID from before)
  - Looking at this response, you can also see the `_version` field, which is increased every time you restart finder (and full batch processing takes place) or a document is changed.

Delete the index with

```bash
curl -XDELETE 'http://172.17.0.3:9200/o2r/'
```

### Local test proxy

If you run the local test proxy from the project [o2r-platform](https://github.com/o2r-project/o2r-platform), you can run queries directly at the o2r api:

http://localhost/api/v1/search?q=*
